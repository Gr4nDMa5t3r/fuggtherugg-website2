        Fugg the Rugg was created out of the need for a quality, honest project in these turbulent times in the Meme Coin World.
        Fugg was created to be a Beacon of Light and a Safe Haven in these dark times and to provide a safe and enjoyable Project
        full of transparency and community engagement.
        <br><br>
        Fugg the Rugg was woven with an unpullable Thread. This grants him great stability, causing him to be an unpullable Rug.
        Meaning, he cannot and will never be pulled, therefore, you will never be scammed by us!
        <br><br>
        So, if youâ€™re tired of being rugged, check out Fugg the Rugg!
